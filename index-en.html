                    Obstacle course “Battle For Tapa“ started in 2019. This obstacle course differs from the other similar events in Estonia by being both mentally and physically tougher and bringing together military and civilian worlds. Several organisations are involved in this event including Estonian Defence Forces and Tapa municipality. 
                    The obstacle course includes many different landscapes and elements including health tracks, a rally course and military training areas. The aim of this new tradition is to bring together the civilian and military worlds and to promote healthy lifestyle in Tapa and also everywhere else in Estonia.
                </p>
                <strong>We promise you that “Battle For Tapa” will give you many different emotions and it will bring many physical and mental challenges!</strong>
